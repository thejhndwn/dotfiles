Ok this is just going to be for setting up a personal machine. Personal.
This is not for setting up a server. Although I wish to make a repo for that too.


for good setup ideas please submit a PR
pce 2 4ll 1^v4D3R5!


## Installation
To install just download the repo locally and run the install.sh
```
bash install.sh
```


### Dependencies/Assumptions
- assumes you have go installed at /usr/local/go
- assumes you are running a bash shell, with a typical ~/.profiles and (or some direction to a ~/.bashrc

## TODO
- split up the planner into private repo, but add an installation script
- add caps lock, esc, and ctrl key remaps
- add nvim installation
- add go and python installation
- remove the env loading stuff it's so bad, just keep it in .bashrc
- rewrite ./scripts/plan into python
- add a command to commit and push/pr to all the .git directory's under $PROJECT_DIR
