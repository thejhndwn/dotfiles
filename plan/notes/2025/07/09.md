[2025-07-09 02:27:30] TEST AGAIN
[2025-07-09 02:28:25] LAST TEST
[2025-07-09 02:30:25] just finished notes command, going to log it. highlights aren't that important yet. I mean it's basically the same thing as the notes command since the weekly highlights are going to be at the bottom of the file, then we just need selective highlighting, or highlights should open the directory or something, I'm not sure. We can figure out how highlights works when we figure out how todo works
[2025-07-09 03:02:24] ok now only need to finish the marking system
[2025-07-09 03:41:54] can't figure out the marking system
[2025-07-09 21:02:58] I didn't finish up a few things today, like chinese, the avatar work, or applying for jobs, making hte youtube channel, or finding some books to read. I'll let it go today.

but it was because I was distracted with youtube during the workout, distracted with tft during the day, and my sleep wasn't good so I wasn't able to focus as well.

so I'm going to let it go today so that I can go to sleep early tonight, so I can walk and workout tomorrow early in the morning, and I think that we are going to have to move the chinese lesson to early in the morning too, cause otherwise i'm just not going to do it.

Otherwise learning the cs stuff during the day is easy and I honestly go down too many rabbit holes.


I'm going to go for a walk and then probably call it a night. During the walk I want to find a good chinese book and show to watch and read. I also want to get to the bototm of the interpreter vs compiler thing, find a good paper to read, and i'm not sure yet, but yeah find a good chines book and show and do some coding reading
