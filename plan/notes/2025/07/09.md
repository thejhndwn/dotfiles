[2025-07-09 02:27:30] TEST AGAIN
[2025-07-09 02:28:25] LAST TEST
[2025-07-09 02:30:25] just finished notes command, going to log it. highlights aren't that important yet. I mean it's basically the same thing as the notes command since the weekly highlights are going to be at the bottom of the file, then we just need selective highlighting, or highlights should open the directory or something, I'm not sure. We can figure out how highlights works when we figure out how todo works
