## notes
These past few days I've been playing a little too much Persona 3 Reload. I just reset my save file tho :( and I'm going to stop playing now. During my work I need to push through in these cases. And yeah I've been unproductive this week because of that...i'm goign to go to sleep earlier today. I mean we're at a good point of getting the work done, but I think I can sleep earlier today and it'll help everything else. I'll plan tomorrow and go to sleep.
